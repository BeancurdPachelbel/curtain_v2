# curtain_v2
The curtain motor base on stepper motor, belongs to smart home v2

The stepper motor is controled by the timer's interrupt. 

The range of the motor's speed is from 30RPM to 150RPM, converts into frequency is from 100Hz to 500Hz, which means each pulse that the ESP32 generate will be delay 2ms until next pulse is generated.

Accelerate the stepper, create a new task to change the value, update the readme

will add hall sensor support, seems much more stableï¼Œ dual head stepper, and lcd as a

## FAQ
### What's relationship between the rotate speed and the frequency of the stepper motor ?
The formular is as follow: &nbsp; ![formular](http://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=tx&chl=\Large\frac{\frac{360*Divider}{StepAngle}\times%20RPM}{60}=Frequency)

RPM means Revolutions Per Minute.

The unit of Frequency is Hz.


## Goal 2: Redesign the project's achitecture
### List the functions that needs to be implemented.

- Communicate with server by mqtt, thus the cummunitaion's link is recommended as follows: 
	- [x] **SmartConfig**(It will be deployed when the chip first boots)
	- [x] **WIFI**(required)
	- [x] **MQTT**(required)

- Stepper motor rotates in the direction of clockwise and counterclockwise
- Read the main circuit's current from the module INA226 in short delay(the unit is ms)

### According to the functions' list, creat the relatively reasonable module
- wifi_unit
- mqtt_unit
- stepper_unit
- ir_unit
- ota_unit
- main

### Delete redundant and unuseful code
### Optimize the functions and annotations
